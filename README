NOTE: This program is in a very early state and should probably not be used
      by anyone except people who want to help with development. The FIT files
      it produces are sometimes padded with NULLs making them hard to use
      with other program. There is also close to no error checking. I'm only
      making this avaible early due to interest.

Usage: python garmin.py

This program extracts all activity FIT files from a Garmin Forerunner 610
watch and writes them to the current directory. The first time it runs it
attempts to sync with the watch. This produces an authfile which is written
to the current directory. On startup this program will try to read that file
to avoid having to resync.
