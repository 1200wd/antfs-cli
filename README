Important Notes
==============================================================================

This program is in a very early state and should probably not be used by
anyone except people who want to help with development. The FIT files it
produces are sometimes padded with NULL making them hard to use with other
program. There is also close to no error checking. I'm only making this
available early due to interest.

Requirements
==============================================================================

- PyUSB 1.0 (seems to be a bug which makes it segfaults on version before
  Alpha 2). It is recommended to use pip to install PyUSB:
  
  pip install pyusb

- Install udev rules (recommended). This is only needed if you want to avoid
  running the program as root. Install with:

  sudo cp resources/ant-usbstick2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

Usage
==============================================================================

Usage: python garmin.py

This program extracts all activity FIT files from a Garmin Forerunner 610
watch and writes them to the current directory. The first time it runs it
attempts to sync with the watch. This produces an authfile which is written
to the current directory. On startup this program will try to read that file
to avoid having to re-sync.
