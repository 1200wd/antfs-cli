Requirements
==============================================================================

- openant 0.1 - https://github.com/Tigge/openant

Usage
==============================================================================

Usage: python antfs-cli.py

This program extracts all activity FIT files from a device and writes them
to a folder (see file locations below). The first time it runs it attempts
to sync with the watch. This produces an authfile which is written to the
same folder. On startup this program will try to read that file to avoid
having to re-sync.

File locations
==============================================================================

Simple answer (probably correct for most people):

 - Your files are placed in ~/.config/antfs-cli/

Correct answer:

 - FIT files and authfiles are stored in an the location specified by the XDG
   Base Directory specification. It uses the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME with
   $HOME/.config as backup. In this directory a antfs-cli folder is created
   in which a folder for each device is created. Both the .FIT files and
   authfile are stored in this device-specific folder.

Supported devices
==============================================================================

Any ANT-FS device supported by openant should work. Currently the ones that
